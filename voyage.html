                            In 512 AD, inspired by Scottish St. Barinthus, Brendan decided to embark on a spiritual journey in search of the Isle of the Blessed.
                            He assembled a group of fourteen monks to accompany him on his voyage from Brandon Creek on 
                            the Dingle Peninsula on the South West coat of Ireland.

                        <p>
                            The group built a currach or naomhóg as it's called locally, from wood and covered in animal hydes.
                            Before setting out Brendan and the monks fast at three-day intervals for forty nights.

                            One of the first islands that Brendan and his companions encounter is the 
                            Island of Sheep so called because of the numerous flocks which roamed its hills. 
                            This is believed to be the Faroe Islands, faroe meaning sheep.

                            After a short stay on the Island of Sheep the crew encounter 
                            other islands including the Paradise of Birds, the Isle of the 
                            Smiths and the Land of Crystal Pillars. The Paradise of Birds is believed to be
                            Mykines the westernmost of the Faroe Islands, renowned for its puffin colony.

                            The Isle of the smiths is described in the Navigatio as an island with rivers of gold where
                            demons threw down lumps of fiery slag causing the sea to boil or bubble. Many believe these are references to volcanic activity 
                            around Iceland at the time.

                            The manuscript also describes a land of crystal pillars, these are thought to be icebergs
                            that Brendan and his crew encountered on their route along the North Atlantic. In fact during Severin’s 
                            recreation of the voyage his boat was punctured by floating ice off the coast of Canada.

                            After travelling for 7 years, returning to the same islands many times, Brendan
                            and the monks sail through the region of fog and finally arrive in the Promised
                            Land for Saints believed to be America. They spend 40 days exploring, before returning to 
                            Ireland awed by what they had seen.

                            The Navigatio Sancti Brendani was known widely in Europe throughout the Middle Ages.
                            It is believed that Christopher Columbus learned how the currents and winds influenced
                            travel routes across the Atlantic from the manuscript and followed this on all his
                            voyages.

                            Tim Severin’s recreation of Brendan’s voyage helps to support the theory that Brendan
                            reached America. He identified many of the geographic locations
                            detailed in the Navigatio while demonstrating that such a transatlantic journey in a
                            currach was possible.
