                    <p>In 512 AD Brendan assembled a group of fourteen monks to accompany him on his voyage from Brandon
                        Creek on the Dingle Peninsula in search of the Isle of the Blessed.
                        Before setting out Brendan and the monks fast at three-day intervals for forty nights.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>One of the first islands that Brendan and his companions encounter is the Island of Sheep so
                        called because of the numerous flocks which roamed its hills.
                        This is believed to be the Faroe Islands.

                <div id="volcano">
                    <p>After a short stay on the Island of Sheep Brendan and his crew encounter a giant whale named
                        Jasconius. Believing it to be an island at first, they land and disembark.
                        Once they light a fire the island starts to move, terrified they retreat to their boat and set
                        sail while Jasconius swims away.<br>

                    <p>
                        Other places that Brendan and his crew arrive at include the Paradise of Birds, the Isle of the
                        Smiths and the Land of Crystal Pillars.<br>

                    <p>
                        The Isle of the smiths is described in the Navigatio as an island with rivers of gold where
                        demons threw down lumps of fiery slag,
                        many believe these are references to volcanic activity around Iceland at the time.

                    <p>
                        The manuscript also describes a land of crystal pillars, these are believed to be icebergs
                        that Brendan and his crew encountered on their route.
