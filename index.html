                <h3>Early Days</h3>
                <p>
                    Brendan was born in Fenit, Co.Kerry on the south west coast of Ireland. Brendan was a monk with a
                    passion for travelling on the sea.
                    He was adventurous and fearlessly navigated the seas in handmade wooden framed boats called currachs, 
                    with no lighthouses or modern navigation equipment.<!-- His earlier travels took him to Argyll, Wales
                    and Brittany.-->

               <h3>The Voyage</h3> 
               <p>
                In 512 AD Brendan set out on his legendary 7 year voyage in search of the isle of the blessed. It is believed that 
                his journey took him from Brandon Creek in West Kerry northward across the Atlantic 
                reaching Newfoundland and America. A Latin manuscript called Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis details this epic journey.

                <h3>Recreating</h3>
                <p>
                  In May 1976 almost 1400 years later, Tim Severin a British explorer set out to prove that Brendan’s voyage was 
                  indeed possible. He constructed a replica of Brendan’s boat and with a crew of 3 others set sail from Brandon Creek 
                  to follow the same route St. Brendan had taken in 512 AD. 13 months later Tim and his crew arrived 
                  in Newfoundland.

                <p>
                  Brendan returned to Ireland where he established numerous monasteries and churches, he died in 578 at Annaghdown in Co. Galway. 
                  Brendan is patron saint of boatmen, mariners, sailors, whales and the US Navy. Saint Brendan's feast day is celebrated on
                  May 16th marked with a pilgrimage on Mount Brandon on the Dingle Peninsula. Saint Brendan’s festival takes place annually in 
                  Fenit Co. Kerry.
